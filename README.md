KeyboardLatencyTester
---------------------

Simple project that lights an LED on keyboard key down, and turns it off on key up.  Can be used with a slo-mo camera to test the latency of keyboards.

Components:
 * Arduino Uno
 * USB Host Shield 2
 * LED + resistor (pin 7)

Note - I needed to add 3 solder bridges to get the USB host shield working
